This is a puppet module to edit Linux kernel params using sysctl under the running kernel using a native type/provider.  It modifies both the running kernel, and optionally will persist settings in /etc/sysctl.conf

EXAMPLE USAGE:

# puppet resource sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range permanent=yes value='32768 61000'
notice: /Sysctl[net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range]/value: value changed '32768 61001' to '32768 61000'
sysctl { 'net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range':
  ensure    => 'present',
  permanent => 'yes',
  value     => '32768 61000',
}

There are some things to be aware of:

First - by default the available params are available on your platform by running sysctl -a

Running puppet resource will give you available kernel tunables in the Puppet DSL

To put things into /etc/sysctl.conf (use path => '/etc/something' to alter the target file) use

  permanent => yes|no

You can stick pretty much any string in value, note for multiwords use a single space - the provider squashes multiple spaces between single values to a single space.
